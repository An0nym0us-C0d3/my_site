Its very discouraging to say the least. Ive been working on court percentage, taking advantage of short balls, attacking the ball to players weak side. I have some success on this. I just feel like my net game is very weak... Im not as reactive to go to net, and if I do, I dont know how to position myself for a good volley and unsure if I am on the right moment to even go to the net. This causes the opponent to pass, lob and leave me defenseless instead of being able to pressure.\n\nMy forehand is good. I use it a lot and I score. But as game lengthens, fatigue sets in, and my pace decrease on those shots. So I am better during the first set and decline because of fatigue.\n\nMy serve - is very shaky. I thought I had my first serve down, but I lost it. Thats a story for another day...\n\nI just got to play to be tactical.. shorten points by playing differently. By making the first move, I can prob do this. I might be able to end the point quickly for either both of us - hah. \n\nAnyway.
